New things that are done on this day include creating haiku, playing games like sugoroku, fukuwarai, kite flying, hanetsuki, and karuta. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is also popular around this time. Some people may fall asleep on this night for the first time since rising on December 31st, and so the dream that one has this night is called hatsuyume, first dream. If this dream has Mount Fuji, a hawk, and an eggplant, the dreamer has good luck. The first sunrise is considered momentous.
